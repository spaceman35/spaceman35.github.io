      <h2>[ About this site ]</h2>
      <p>Nolstagic for the old Web 1.0 days of GeoCities and Angelfire websites...where we owned our own little nook of the 'world wide web,' I decided to recreate a site like I would've had back in middle school. No wordpress templates, no complex code, ads, or trackers -- just super simple html & css created with notepad. I always loved how personal these old sites were! Each one was entirely handmade by the creator and most looked quite terrible. I think that was part of their charm. We were always so proud of our 'ugly' creations and learned a lot about computers during the process. We'd share code snippets at school and create terrible ASCII banners and those little 88x31px buttons using MS Paint. I remember making a terrible Legend of Dragoon fansite back in ~2003 and creating forum sig banners in a cracked Photoshop 7...those were the days. The internet was truly the wild west, and that era will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>    
      
      <p>I've also been growing increasingly frustrated at the modern state of the internet. I want to own my data and get away from chasing internet points and only seeing what algorithms decide to show me. This will be my own little slice of cyberspace for musings, some photos, and a landing page for ongoing projects, hosted and entirely owned by me. I prefer emails over comments, so drop me a line if you wanna catch up or chat ^_^
