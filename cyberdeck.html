      <h2>[ Firefly Cyberdeck ]</h2>
      <br>
      <p>25 Oct 2020<br>
      I've wanted a hardware project to work on for a while now, and I finally know what I want to do. This year, full of a pandemic, a government we can't trust, rampant wildfires, and civil unrest on both ends of the political spectrum, has sparked many people's interest in prepping again. I've always been an absurdly prepared person and have always had a good stash of water, rations, and equipment to survive if shit really went bad, but I do it just for fun and for basic peace of mind so world events don't stress me out as much. So that's the background context of the world I live in right now. Add to that some excellent post-apocalyptic games and movies I've been into lately (Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Bladerunner 2049, and the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 game to name a few), and man, it's a vibe. To combine all this, I thought I'd make an end-of-the-world computer to survive the initial apocalypse and provide valuable tools for the rebuilding phase. Will this be needed? Of course not. But it'll be a fun way to build a unique, purpose-built computer and I'm going to love all the work that comes along with it. And if it is needed? Well, I guess I'll be glad I was weirdly into this stuff and decided to make my own "cyberdeck."</p>
      <p>[ General features ]</p>
      <p><ol>
      <li>Survivability: I want it to withstand an EMP event (likely storing in grounded, copper-foil lined box).<br><br>
      <li>Reliability: I want it to be built with standard parts I could scavenge around (car fuses, standard Li-ion batteries, etc.).<br><br>
      <li>Portability: I plan on building it all enclosed in a pelican case.<br><br>
      <li>Weather resistance: Pelican cases are already good to go, so if I can avoid modifying it, that'll be ideal. Might not be possible to avoid given some wanted features.<br><br>
      <li>Communication: I haven't figured out what I want to do here yet, but I'll either incorporate my HT radio or build a software-defined radio. I might need to add an antenna port to the case, assuming I can waterproof it.<br><br>
      <li>Knowledge: The entirety of wikipedia and a library of helpful books and pdfs will be included. I'll also include an offline mapping resource (haven't figured out what I'll do here yet).<br><br>
      <li>Entertainment: I plan on incorporating old N64 or Gameboy ROMS so the apocalypse isn't so boring. <br><br>
      <li>Power: I'll have an internal battery that you can charge via the front console, but I'd also like to incorporate solar charging or hand-crank charging.<br><br>
      <li>Aesthetics: I want it to just look cool. This project is just for fun, so might as well embrace the cyberpunk vibe and make it look like it'd be used by Firefly (organization in The Last of Us)<br><br>
      <li>Networking: I might incorporate a network switch to allow for pentesting or connecting other devices if needed.<br><br>
      <li>Access Point: I'll install a Kiwix hotspot onto the Raspberry Pi so that anyone near me can access the full knowledge base.<br><br>
      <li>Compatibility: I'll include USB A and C connectors.<br><br>
      <li>Internet access: It'll be able to connect to normal WiFi signals, in case those still exist.<br><br>
      <li>Touchscreen: I may include a small trackpad just in case, but a touchscreen display would be easier and more compact than including a mouse. <br><br>
      <li>Security: I'll have my own important documents backed up here, so I'll ensure it's encrypted and secured. <br><br>
      <li>Linux: I don't have much experience with Linux distros, so this will be a fun place to experiment.<br><br>
      <li>Mechanical keyboard: I love my desktop mechanical keyboard, but I bought it fully built. I'll be building this unique octolinear keyboard from scratch.<br><br>
      <li>3D Printed: For the brackets and supporting structure, I'd like to get practice with 3D printing. I'll likely be buying and assembling a DIY 3D printer as part of this project.<br><br>
      <li>Relevant to my professional work: I'm in grad school for Model-Based Systems Engineering, focusing on CubeSats. Why not use my thesis work for this project too? I plan on using MBSE practices in the process. These general features will act as the "stakeholder needs" as I build requirements.
