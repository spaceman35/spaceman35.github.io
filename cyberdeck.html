      <h2>[ Firefly Cyberdeck ]</h2>
      <br>
      <p>25 Oct 2020<br>
      I've wanted a hardware project to work on for a while now, and I finally know what I want to do. This year has sparked many people's interest in prepping again... a year of a global pandemic, a government we can't trust, rampant wildfires, and civil unrest on both ends of the political spectrum. I've always been an absurdly prepared person and have always had a good stash of water, rations, and equipment to survive if shit really went bad, but I do it just for fun and for basic peace of mind so world events don't stress me out as much. So that's the background context of the world I live in right now. Add to that some excellent post-apocalyptic games and movies I've been into lately (Horizon: Zero Dawn, The Last of Us Part 2, Final Fantasy VII Remake, Bladerunner 2049, and the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 game to name a few), and man, it's a vibe. To combine all this, I thought I'd make an end-of-the-world computer to survive the initial apocalypse and provide valuable tools for the rebuilding phase. <br><br>
      Will this be needed? Of course not. But it'll be a fun way to build a unique, purpose-built computer and I'm going to love all the work that comes along with it and the new skills I'll need to develop. And if it is needed? Well, I guess I'll be glad I was weirdly into this stuff and decided to make my own "cyberdeck." If you've read any Gibson novels, this deck is supposed to be a hybrid of the Ono-Sendai and a Hosaka and the Firefly aspect will draw on inspiration from The Last of Us's post-apocalyptic organization. </p>
      <p>[ General features ]</p>
      <p><ol>
      <li>Survivability: I want it to withstand an EMP event (likely storing in grounded, copper-foil lined case).<br><br>
      <li>Reliability: I want it to be built with standard parts I could scavenge around (car fuses, standard Li-ion batteries, etc.).<br><br>
      <li>Portability: I plan on building it all enclosed in a pelican 1300 case.<br><br>
      <li>Weather resistance: Pelican cases are already good to go, so if I can avoid modifying it, that'll be ideal. Might not be possible to avoid given some wanted features like antenna ports.<br><br>
      <li>Communication: I haven't figured out what I want to do here yet, but I'll either incorporate my HT radio or build a software-defined radio. I might need to add an antenna port to the case, assuming I can waterproof it.<br><br>
      <li>Knowledge: The entirety of wikipedia and a library of helpful books and pdfs will be included. I'll also include an offline mapping resource (haven't figured out what I'll do here yet).<br><br>
      <li>Entertainment: I plan on incorporating old N64 or Gameboy ROMS so the apocalypse isn't so boring. <br><br>
      <li>Power: I'll have an internal battery that you can charge via the front panel, but I'd also like to incorporate solar charging as a backup.<br><br>
      <li>Aesthetics: I want it to just look cool. This project is just for fun, so might as well embrace the cyberpunk vibe and make it look like it'd be used by Firefly (organization in The Last of Us). I also want to use classic tactile switches, because real metal switches are awesome.<br><br>
      <li>Networking: I might incorporate a network switch to allow for pentesting or connecting other devices if needed (not a priority, need to figure out available space on front panel).<br><br>
      <li>Access Point: I'll install a Kiwix hotspot onto the Raspberry Pi so that anyone near me can access the full knowledge base even if the internet is down.<br><br>
      <li>Compatibility: I'll include USB A and C connectors.<br><br>
      <li>Internet access: It'll be able to connect to normal WiFi signals, in case those still exist.<br><br>
      <li>Touchscreen: I may include a small trackpad just in case, but a touchscreen display would be easier and more compact than including a mouse. <br><br>
      <li>Security: I'll have my own important documents backed up here, so I'll ensure it's encrypted and secured. <br><br>
      <li>Easy to use: I'll have clear instructions included, in case I'm not around to use it. I want to make it a simple process to operate and access the knowledge base, even though it's a Debian-based system.<br><br>
      <li>Mechanical keyboard: I love my desktop mechanical keyboard, but I bought it fully built. I'll be building this unique octolinear keyboard from scratch so it fits in the small space.<br><br>
      <li>3D Printed: For the brackets and supporting structure, I'd like to get practice with 3D printing. I'll likely be buying and assembling a DIY 3D printer as part of this project.<br><br>
      <li>Relevant to my professional work: I'm in grad school for Model-Based Systems Engineering, focusing on CubeSats. Why not use my thesis work for this project too? I plan on using MBSE practices in the process to build upon my research. These general features will act as the "stakeholder needs" as I build requirements, do functional and physical decompositions, traceability, and verification & validation of the requirements.

      This project has already been fun! Over the last few days, I purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb version) and a 7" capacitive touch screen and started learning command line linux. I've briefly messed around with Ubuntu linux years ago, but never learned how to navigate or run/install things via the command line until this week. With lots of trial and error, I'm finally comfortable remotely ssh-ing into the pi, transferring documents from my desktop, and installing/running applications on the pi. So far, I've gotten a Kiwix hotspot running with all of Wikipedia and several stackoverflow categories as zim files. I also installed RetroPie and am in the process of transferring ROMs over some old GBA and GBC ROMs as tests. I'll be installing an SDR over the next few days and trying to get that to work, and once I get all the components laid out and working with each other, I'll figure out the panel specifications for any inputs/outputs I need. The structural component will be the hardest for me I think, so I'm going to focus on the software side first.

      Man, this has been tough already. Yesterday I built a keyboard for the first time (Preonic v3), which was harder than I thought it'd be. Troubleshooting the assembly wasn't too hard (a few bent pins), but removing the switches without a switch puller was really tough. Only after finishing did I figure out that there's a tool specifically for that....lessons learned. Then, learning how to flash the unique keyboard with a keymap was totally new to me. I had to get homebrew running on my iMac and run some command line scripts to finally flash the keyboard firmware with a custom layout. And since it's a weirdly compact keyboard, it's missing some keys that I need for command line work, like the "-". I'll need to go back and add another keyboard layer to accomodate those extra symbol keys that are necessary for what I'll use it for. Even though it took me half a day to just assemble and get a keyboard working, it's been a fun learning process!<br>
      Today, I was messing around with a Software Defined Radio (SDR). I got the SDR working on my iMac and on my Surface laptop, but I haven't moved it over to the Raspberry Pi yet. I really wanted to pick up the HF and shortwave bands, so I bought an extra upconverter to get the lower frequencies, but I haven't been able to get that to work properly yet. Even if I just put it in passthrough mode, I'm having trouble picking up normal FM radio stations. This cyberdeck won't be a radio operating station (no Tx), but I want to be able to receive and monitor HF all the eay through VHF/UHF. The SDR software includes a handy waterfall too, which is useful, but more importantly looks badass. I'll continue to fiddle with the upconverter and learning the normal SDR over the coming days to figure out how I want to incorporate it into the cyberdeck build.
