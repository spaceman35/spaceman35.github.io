      <h2>Welcome to my space!</h2>
      <p>This is my little cozy corner of the internet for whatever I want to use it for. Instagram isn't great for writing or full-res pictures, and I can't stand facebook or twitter. I also just love the aesthetic of web 1.0 days pre-html5 and I miss the old webrings and communities on the web. I'll mess around with this so I can have a place to write or document various projects I have planned. I hope you enjoy your stay!</p>

      Migrated this site over to GitHub and practiced that workflow.</p>

      I was reading William Gibson's Neuromancer today and came across this passage: <br><br>
      <i>'A year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading nightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the corners he cut in Night City, and he'd still see the matrix in his dreams, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colourless void... The Sprawl was a long, strange way home now over the Pacific, and he was no Console Man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, hands clawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.' </i><br>
      
      <p>After I read this, I felt a rush of ideas and motivation and had to put down my kindle down and start making this website. I've been in a cyberpunk/vaporwave/bladerunner vibe for the last year or so (appropriate, given the state of things in 2020), and this book sparked a few ideas. First, I'd like to further distance myself from what I think is bad about the modern internet without going totally invisible. Check. Second, I've missed doing hardware projects. I'm currently in graduate school, and I've been able to work with tiny CubeSat components. Tinkering with wires and batteries and machined aluminum sparks so much joy for me, and I finally have some ideas for personal projects. This site will be a place to document some of those. I've been in a bit of a funk lately, but all these ideas have propelled me out and back into a creative space. </p>
