      <p>Essentially, this is an end of the world computer. Housed in a waterproof Pelican case and stored in a copper-lined and grounded box, it should survive most any disaster or EMP event. If shit were to really hit the fan, I could bust this baby out and…do things? The original goal was to create a computer I could see the Firefly organization using in “The Last of Us.” The aesthetics of the OS are all themed with Firefly touches and there are some other Firefly Easter eggs too. Along the way, it kind of morphed into doubling as a RetroPie machine and acting as a HF/UHF/VHF radio station. Will I ever need this? Absolutely not. Was it fun though? Heck yes.
